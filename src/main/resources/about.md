[I](https://pehrs.com) love open-source and free sources of inspiration and learning.

The control-boot is a simple (incomplete) experiment to see how to build an [IDP](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/) 
like [Backstage](https://demo.backstage.io/catalog?filters%5Bkind%5D=component&filters%5Blifecycles%5D=production&filters%5Blifecycles%5D=experimental&filters%5Buser%5D=all) with 
a [React](https://react.dev/) Front-end 
and a Java Back-end based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
